See the <a href=\"#section9-3\">&quot;Read more&quot;</a> section below if you&#39;d like to know even more about these terms!</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-websites-static-websites--jekyll-\">Dynamic websites, static websites, &amp; Jekyll <a id=\"section0-1\"></a></h3>\n<p><em>Dynamic websites</em>, such as those created and managed by a content management system such as <a href=\"https://www.drupal.com/\">Drupal</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a>, and <a href=\"https://omeka.org/\">Omeka</a>, pull information from a database to fill in the content on a webpage. When you search for a book on Amazon.com, for example, the search results page you are shown didn’t already exist as a full HTML page; instead, Amazon.com has a template for search results page that includes things all results pages share (like the main menu and Amazon logo), but it queries the database to insert the results of that search you initiated into that template.</p>\n<p><em>Static websites</em>, on the other hand, do not use a database to store information; instead, all information to be displayed on each webpage is already contained in an HTML file for that webpage. The HTML pages that make up a static site can be completely written by hand, or you can offload some of this work using something like Jekyll.</p>\n<p><em>Jekyll</em> is software that helps you &quot;generate&quot; or create a <em>static website</em> (you may see Jekyll described as a &quot;static site generator&quot;). Jekyll takes page templates—those things like main menus and footers that you&#39;d like shared across all the web pages on your site, where manually writing the HTML to include them on every webpage would be time-consuming. These templates are combined with other files with specific information (e.g. a file for each blog post on the site) to generate full HTML pages for website visitors to see. Jekyll doesn’t need to do anything like querying a database and creating a new HTML page (or filling in a partial one) when you visit a webpage; it’s already got the HTML pages fully formed, and it just updates them when/if they ever change.</p>\n<p>Note that when someone refers to a &quot;Jekyll website&quot;, they really mean a static (plain HTML) website that has been created using Jekyll. Jekyll is software that creates websites. Jekyll isn&#39;t actually &quot;running&quot; the live website; rather, Jekyll is a &quot;static site generator&quot;: it helps you create the static site files, which you then host just as you would any other HTML website.</p>\n<p>Because static sites are really just text files (no database to complicate matters), you can easily <em>version</em> a static site—that is, use a tool to keep track of the different versions of the site over time by tracking how the text files that compose the site have been altered. Versioning is especially helpful when you need to merge two files (e.g. two students are writing a blog post together, and you want to combine their two versions), or when you want compare files to look for differences among them (e.g. &quot;How did the original About page describe this project?&quot;). Versioning is great when working with a team (e.g. helps you combine and track different people&#39;s work), but it&#39;s also useful when writing or running a website on your own.</p>\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/\">Jekyll here</a> or <a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators\">static site generators here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"github--github-pages-\">GitHub &amp; GitHub Pages <a id=\"section0-2\"></a></h3>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a></em> is a free place to store the files that run a website and host that website for people to visit (it only works for particular types of website, like basic HTML sites or Jekyll sites, and does not host databases).</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a></em> is a visual way to use <em><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/documentation\">git</a></em>, a system for <em>versioning</em>: keeping track of changes to computer files (including code and text documents) over time (as explained <a href=\"#section0-1\">above</a>). If you&#39;re curious, here&#39;s <a href=\"https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/\">a friendly lesson for exploring GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-reasons-for-using-a-static-website-\">What are the reasons for using a static website? <a id=\"section0-3\"></a></h3>\n<p>Options like <a href=\"https://www.drupal.com/\">Drupal</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a>, and <a href=\"https://omeka.org/\">Omeka</a> are good for the needs of complex, interactive websites like Amazon or an interactive digital edition of a novel—but for many blogs, project websites, and online portfolios, a static website (such as a website created using Jekyll) can do everything you need while providing some nice perks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Maintenance</strong>: Updates and maintenance are needed far less often (less than once a year vs. weekly-monthly).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Preservation:</strong> No database means that the text files making up your site are all you need to save to preserve and replicate your site. It&#39;s easy to back your site up or submit it to an institutional repository.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Learning:</strong> Because there isn&#39;t a database and there aren&#39;t a bunch of code files providing features you might not even need, there are far fewer actual pieces of your website—it&#39;s easier to go through them all and actually know what each does, should you be so inclined. Therefore, it&#39;s much easier to become both a basic and an advanced Jekyll user.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>More customization possible</strong>: Since learning to master your website is easier, things you&#39;ll definitely want to do, like changing the look (the &quot;theme&quot;) of a Jekyll-created site, are much easier than altering the look of a WordPress or Drupal site.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Free hosting:</strong> While many website tools like Drupal, WordPress, and Omeka are free, hosting them (paying for someone to serve your website&#39;s files to site visitors) can cost money.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Versioning:</strong> Hosting on GitHub Pages means your site is linked into GitHub&#39;s visual interface for git versioning, so you can track changes to your site and always roll back to an earlier state of any blog post, page, or the site itself if needed. This includes uploaded files you might want to store on the site, like old syllabi and publications. (Versioning is <a href=\"#section0-1\">explained in more detail above</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Security:</strong> There&#39;s no database to protect from hackers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Minimal website files and no database to query mean a faster page-loading time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Creating a static website using Jekyll offers more perks in addition to all the benefits of a hand-coded HTML static website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learning:</strong> It&#39;s easier to get started customizing your site and writing its content, since you won&#39;t need to learn or use HTML.</li>\n<li><strong>Built for blogging:</strong> Jekyll was built to support blog posts, so it&#39;s easy to blog (add new, date-sorted content) and do related tasks like display an archive of all blog posts by month, or include a link to the three most recent blog posts at the bottom of each post.</li>\n<li><strong>Templating automates repeated tasks:</strong> Jekyll makes it easy to automate repeated website tasks via its &quot;templating&quot; system: you can create content that should, for example, appear on the header and footer of every page (e.g. logo image, main menu), or following the title of every blog post (e.g. author name and publication date). This templated information will automatically be repeated on every appropriate webpage, instead of forcing you to manually rewrite that information on every webpage where you want it to appear. Not only does this save a lot of copying and pasting—if you ever want to change something that appears on every page of your website (e.g. a new site logo or a new item in the main menu), changing it once in a template will change in on every place it appears on your website.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"preparing-for-installation-\">Preparing for installation <a id=\"section1\"></a></h2>\n<p>We&#39;re ready to get to work! In the rest of this lesson, we&#39;re going to get a few programs installed on your computer, use the command line to install a few things that can only be installed that way, look at and customize a private version of your website, and finally make your website publicly accessible on the Web. If you run into problems at any point in this lesson, see the <a href=\"#section9\">help section</a> for how to ask questions or report issues.</p>\n<p>In this section, we&#39;ll make sure you have a couple things ready on your computer for when we need them later in the lesson by covering what operating system you can use (i.e. Mac/Windows/Linux), creating a GitHub account and installing the GitHub app, why you should use a &quot;text editor&quot; program to work on your website, and how to use the command line.</p>\n<p>Everything this lesson has you install is a standard and trusted web development tool, so it isn&#39;t important to know exactly what each of these things do before installing it. I&#39;ll try to balance more information about the things it&#39;s most useful for you to fully understand, with providing a brief explanation for each piece and also link to further information in case you&#39;d like to know more about what you&#39;re putting on your computer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"operating-systems-\">Operating systems <a id=\"section1-0\"></a></h3>\n<p>This tutorial should be usable by both Mac and Windows users. Jekyll can also work for Linux; this tutorial uses the GitHub Desktop software (Mac and Windows only) for simplicity, but Linux users will need to use git over the command line instead (not covered here).</p>\n<p>Jekyll isn&#39;t officially supported for Windows, which means none of the official Jekyll documentation (the pages that walk you through setting up Jekyll and what its different pieces do, which you could consult instead of or in addition to this lesson) addresses Windows use. I&#39;ve used <a href=\"https://davidburela.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/easily-install-jekyll-on-windows-with-3-command-prompt-entries-and-chocolatey/\">David Burela&#39;s Windows instructions</a> to note the places in the <a href=\"#section2\">&quot;Installing Dependencies&quot; section</a> when Windows users should do something different; the rest of the lesson should work the same for both Mac and Windows users, though note that screenshots throughout the lesson are all from a Mac (so thing may look slightly different for a Windows user).</p>\n<h3 id=\"github-user-account-\">GitHub user account <a id=\"section1-1\"></a></h3>\n<p><em>A GitHub user account will let you host your website (make it available for others to visit) for free on GitHub (we&#39;ll cover how in a later step). As a bonus, it will also let you keep track of versions of the website and its writing as it grows or changes over time.</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub.com</a> and click on the &quot;Sign up&quot; button on the upper right. Write your desired username. This will be visible to others, identify you on GitHub, and also be part of your site&#39;s URL; for example, the author&#39;s GitHub username is amandavisconti and her demo Jekyll site&#39;s URL is <a href=\"http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/\">http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/</a>. (<em>Note you can also purchase your own domain name and use it for this site, but that won&#39;t be covered in this tutorial</em>). Also write your desired email address and password, then click &quot;Create an account&quot;.</li>\n<li>On the next page, click the &quot;Choose&quot; button next to the &quot;Free&quot; plan option, ignore the &quot;Help me set up an organization next&quot; checkbox, and click &quot;Finish sign up&quot;.</li>\n<li><em>Optional</em>: Visit <a href=\"https://github.com/settings/profile\">https://github.com/settings/profile</a> to add a full name (can be your real name, GitHub user name, or something else) and other public profile information, if desired.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"github-desktop-app-\">GitHub Desktop app <a id=\"section1-2\"></a></h3>\n<p><em>The GitHub Desktop app will make updating your live website (one we set it up) easy—instead of using the command line every time you want to update your site, you&#39;ll be able to use an easier visual tool to update your site.</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit the <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">GitHub Desktop site</a> and click on the &quot;Download GitHub Desktop&quot; button to download the GitHub Desktop software to your computer (Mac and Windows only; Linux users will need to use git just via the command line, which is not covered in this version of the tutorial).</li>\n<li>Once the file has completely downloaded, double-click on it and use the following directions to install GitHub Desktop...</li>\n<li>Enter the username and password for the GitHub.com account you created using the steps above. (Ignore the &quot;Add an Enterprise Account&quot; button.) Click &quot;Continue&quot;.</li>\n<li>Enter the name and email address you want the work on your site to be associated with (probably just your public name and work email address, but it&#39;s up to you!).</li>\n<li>On the same page, click the &quot;Install Command Line Tools&quot; button and enter your computer&#39;s username and password if prompted (then click the &quot;Install Helper&quot; button on the prompt). After you get a popup message that all command line tools have successfully installed, click continue.</li>\n<li>The last page will ask &quot;Which repositories would you like to use?&quot;. Ignore this and click the &quot;Done&quot; button.</li>\n<li><em>Optional:</em> Follow the walkthrough of the GitHub Desktop app that will appear (this isn&#39;t necessary; we will cover anything you need to do with GitHub in this lesson).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"text-editor-\">Text editor <a id=\"section1-3\"></a></h3>\n<p>You&#39;ll need to download and install a &quot;text editor&quot; program on your computer for making small customizations to your Jekyll site&#39;s code. Good free options include <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html\">TextWrangler</a> (Mac) or <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">Notepad++</a> (Windows). Software aimed at word processing, like Microsoft Word or Word Pad, isn&#39;t a good choice because it&#39;s easy to forget how to format and save the file, accidentally adding in extra and/or invisible formatting and characters that will break your site. You&#39;ll want something that specifically can save what you write as plaintext (e.g. HTML, Markdown).</p>\n<p><em>Optional:</em> See <a href=\"#section5-2\">the &quot;Authoring in Markdown&quot; section below</a> for notes on a Markdown-specific editing program, which you may also wish to install when you get to the point of authoring webpages and/or blog posts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"command-line-\">Command line <a id=\"section1-4\"></a></h3>\n<p>The command line is a way to interact with your computer using text: it lets you type in commands for actions from simpler things such as &quot;show me a list of the files in this directory&quot; or &quot;change who is allowed to access this file&quot;, to more complex behavior. Sometimes there are nice visual ways to do things on your computer (e.g. the GitHub Desktop app <a href=\"#section1-2\">we installed above</a>), and sometimes you&#39;ll need to use the command line to type out commands to get your computer to do things. The Programming Historian has <a href=\"/lessons/intro-to-bash\">an in-depth lesson exploring the command line written</a> by Ian Milligan and James Baker if you want more information than provided here, but this lesson will cover everything you need to know to complete the lesson (and we&#39;ll only use the command line when it&#39;s necessary or much easier than a visual interface).</p>\n<p>Where the command line uses text commands, a &quot;graphical user interface&quot; (aka GUI) is what you probably normally use to work with your computer: anything where commands are given through a visual interface containing icons, images, mouse-clicking, etc. is a GUI. Often it&#39;s simpler and faster to type in (or cut and paste from a tutorial) a series of commands via the command line, than to do something using a GUI; sometimes there are things you&#39;ll want to do for which no one has yet created a GUI, and you&#39;ll need to do them via the command line.</p>\n<p>The default command line program is called &quot;Terminal&quot; on Macs (located in <em>Applications &gt; Utilities</em>), and &quot;Command Prompt&quot;, &quot;Windows Power Shell&quot;, or &quot;Git Bash&quot; on Windows (these are three different options that each differ in the type of commands they accept; we&#39;ll go in detail on which you should use later in the lesson).</p>\n<p>Below is what a command line window looks like on the author&#39;s Mac (using Terminal). You&#39;ll see something like the <em>Macbook-Air:~ DrJekyll$</em> below in your command line window; that text is called the &quot;prompt&quot; (it&#39;s prompting you to input commands). In the screenshot, <em>Macbook-Air</em> is the name of my computer, and <em>DrJekyll</em> is the user account currently logged in (the prompt will use different names for your computer and username).</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-0.png&quot; caption=&quot;What the command prompt looks like on a Mac&quot; %}</p>\n<p>When asked to open a command line window and enter commands in this lesson, keep the following in mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Commands that you should type (or copy/paste) into the command line are formatted like this:</strong> <code>example of code formatting</code>. Each formatted chunk of code should be copied and pasted into the command line, followed by pressing enter.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Let installation processes run <em>completely</em> before entering new commands.</strong> Sometimes typing a command and pressing enter produces an instantaneous result; sometimes lots of text will start to fill up the command line window, or the command line window will seem to not be doing anything (but something is actually happening behind the scenes, like downloading a file). <strong>When you&#39;ve typed a command and hit enter, you&#39;ll need to wait for that command to completely finish before typing <em>anything else</em></strong>, or you might stop a process in the middle, causing problems.\n{0}. You&#39;ll know your command has completed when the command line spits out the prompt again (e.g. <em>Macbook-Air:~ DrJekyll$</em> on the author&#39;s computer). See the screenshot below for an example of inputting a command, followed by some text showing you what was happening while that command was processed (and sometimes asking you to do something, like enter your password), and finally the reappearance of the command prompt to let you know it&#39;s okay to type something else.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-4.png&quot; caption=&quot;An example of inputting a command, followed by some text showing you what was happening while that command was processed (and sometimes asking you to do something, like enter your password), and finally the reappearance of the command prompt to let you know it’s okay to type something else&quot; %}</p>\n<p>   If you need to do something else at the command line and don&#39;t want to wait, just open a separate command line window (on a Mac, hit command-N or go to <em>Shell &gt; New Window &gt; New Window with Settings-Basic</em>) and do things there while waiting for the process in the other command line window to finish.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Typing or pasting in the same commands a lot, or want to remember something you typed earlier? You can type the <strong>↑</strong> (up arrow) at the command line to scroll through recently typed commands; just press enter after the one you want to use appears.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Starting with macOS Catalina, zsh has replaced bash as the default shell for Macs. This lesson has not been tested on the zsh shell.

Pages are content (like an &quot;About&quot; page) that isn&#39;t organized or displayed chronologically, but might be included in your website&#39;s main menu; posts are meant to be used for content best organized by publication date. The URLs (links) for pages and posts are also different by default (although you can change this): page URLs look like <em>MySite.com/about/</em>, while post URLs look like <em>MySite.com/2016/02/29/my-post-title.html.</em></p>\n<h4 id=\"authoring-in-markdown-\">Authoring in Markdown <a id=\"section5-1\"></a></h4>\n<p>Markdown is a way of formatting your writing for reading on the web: it&#39;s a set of easy-to-remember symbols that show where text formatting should be added (e.g. a # in front of text means to format it as a heading, while a * in front of text means to format it as a bulleted list item). For Jekyll in particular, Markdown means you can write webpages and blog posts in a way that&#39;s comfortable to authors (e.g. no need to look up/add in HTML tags while trying to write an essay), but have that writing show up formatted nicely on the web (i.e. a text-to-HTML convertor).</p>\n<p>We won&#39;t cover Markdown in this lesson; if you&#39;re not familiar with it, for now you can just create posts and pages with no formatting (i.e. no bold/italic, no headers, no bulleted lists). But these are easy to learn how to add: there&#39;s a handy markdown <a href=\"http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html\">reference</a>, as well as <a href=\"/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown\">a Programming Historian lesson by Sarah Simpkin on the hows and whys of writing with Markdown</a>. Check out these links if you&#39;d like to format text (italics, bold, headings, bullet/numbered lists) or add hyperlinks or embedded images and other files.</p>\n<p>Make sure any Markdown cheatsheets you look at are for the &quot;<a href=\"http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html\">kramdown</a>&quot; flavor of Markdown, which is what GitHub Pages (where we&#39;ll be hosting our website) supports. (<em>There are <a href=\"https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark/wiki/Markdown-Flavors\">various &quot;flavors&quot; of Markdown</a> that have subtle differences in what various symbols do, but for the most part frequently used symbols like those that create heading formatting are the same—so you&#39;re actually probably okay using a markdown cheatsheet that doesn&#39;t specify it&#39;s kramdown, but if you&#39;re getting errors on your site using symbols that aren&#39;t included in kramdown might be why</em>).</p>\n<p>You might be interested in &quot;markdown editor&quot; software such as <a href=\"http://www.typora.io/\">Typora</a> (OS X and Windows; free during current beta period), which will let you use popular keyboard shortcuts to write Markdown (e.g. highlight text and press command-B to make it bold) and/or type in Markdown but have it show as it will look on the web (see headings styled like headings, instead of like normal text with a # in front of them).</p>\n<h3 id=\"authoring-pages-\">Authoring pages <a id=\"section5-3\"></a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p>To see an existing page on your website (created as a default part of a Jekyll website <a href=\"#section3\">when you created the rest of your website&#39;s files</a>), navigate to your website folder and open the <strong>about.md</strong> file either in a text editor (e.g. TextWrangler) or a Markdown editor (e.g. Typora) to see the file that creates the &quot;About&quot; page. Also click on the &quot;About&quot; link in the top-right of your webpage to see what the webpage the file creates looks like in a browser.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The stuff between the --- dashes is called &quot;front matter&quot; (<em>note that opening the file in a Markdown editor might make the front matter appear on a gray background instead of between dashes</em>). The front matter tells your site whether to format the content below the front matter as a page or blog post, the title of the post, the date and time the post should show it was published, and any categories you&#39;d like the post or page listed under.</p>\n<p>You can change things in the front matter of a page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>layout:</strong> Keep this as-is (it should say page).</li>\n<li><strong>title:</strong> Change this to the desired page title (unlike posts, no quotation marks around the title). In the screenshot below, I added a page with the title &quot;Resume&quot;.</li>\n<li><strong>permalink:</strong> change the text between the two forward slash marks to the word (<em>or phrase—but you&#39;ll need to use hyphens and not spaces!</em>) that you want to follow your site&#39;s main URL to reach the page.
