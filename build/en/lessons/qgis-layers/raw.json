Quantum or QGIS is an open source alternative to the\nindustry leader, ArcGIS from ESRI. QGIS is multiplatform, which means it\nruns on Windows, Macs, and Linux and it has many of the functions most\ncommonly used by historians. ArcGIS is prohibitively expensive and only\nruns on Windows (though software can be purchased to allow it to run on\nMac). However, many universities have site licenses, meaning students\nand employees have access to free copies of the software (try contacting\nyour map librarian, computer services, or the geography department).\nQGIS is ideal for those without access to a free copy of Arc and it is\nalso a good option for learning basic GIS skills and deciding if you\nwant to install a copy of ArcGIS on your machine. Moreover, any work you\ndo in QGIS can be exported to ArcGIS at a later date if you decide to\nupgrade. The authors tend to use both and are happy to run QGIS on Mac\nand Linux computers for basic tasks, but still return to ArcGIS for more\nadvanced work. In many cases it is not lack of functions, but stability\nissues that bring us back to ArcGIS. For those who are learning Python\nwith the Programming Historian, you will be glad to know that both QGIS\nand ArcGIS use Python as their main scripting language.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installing-qgis\">Installing QGIS</h2>\n<p>Navigate to the <a href=\"http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html\">QGIS Download page</a>. The procedure is a little\ndifferent depending on your operating system. Click on the appropriate\nOperating System. Follow the instructions below.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mac-instructions\">Mac Instructions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For most people it will be best to choose Master release (the one\nthat has a single installer package). You will still need to install\nother software packages before installing QGIS. Under &quot;Download for Mac OS X&quot;, click on\nthe link (<a href=\"http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis\">KyngChaos Qgis download page</a>) and download the\nfile (see screen shot below): 1) QGIS 2.18.13-1 (under\nDownload) for your respective Mac OS (this works with versions from Lion onwards). Then go to the left &quot;software menu&quot; and click on    &quot;<a href=\"http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/archive\">Download Archive</a>&quot;. Under &quot;GDAL Complete&quot; download the file 2) GDAL complete 1.11\nframework package (under Requirements). Install the framework package like any other Mac programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis1.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 1: Click to view full-size image&quot; %}</p>\n<ul>\n<li>once the frameworks are installed, download and install QGIS.</li>\n<li>as with any other Mac application you are using for the first time,\nyou will have to go find the QGIS application in Applications</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"windows-instructions\">Windows Instructions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>under Standalone Installer, click on the link to Download QGIS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis2.jpg&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 2&quot; %}</p>\n<ul>\n<li>double-click on the <code>.exe</code> file to execute</li>\n</ul>\n<p>QGIS is very simple to install in most versions of Linux. Follow the\ninstructions on the download page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prince-edward-island-data\">Prince Edward Island Data</h3>\n<p>We will be using some government data from the Canadian province of\nPrince Edward Island. PEI is a great example because there is a lot of\ndata for free online and because it is Canada&#39;s smallest province,\nmaking the downloads quick! Download PEI shapefiles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to the links below in your web browser, read/accept the\nlicense agreement, and then download the following (they will ask\nfor your name and email with each download). We created the final\ntwo shapefiles, so they should download directly:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=coastline&amp;file_format=SHP\">http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=coastline&amp;file_format=SHP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=lot_town&amp;file_format=SHP\">http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=lot_town&amp;file_format=SHP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=hydronetwork&amp;file_format=SHP\">http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=hydronetwork&amp;file_format=SHP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=forest_35&amp;file_format=SHP\">http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=forest_35&amp;file_format=SHP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=nat_parks&amp;file_format=SHP\">http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=nat_parks&amp;file_format=SHP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/assets/PEI_highway.zip\">PEI Highways</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/assets/PEI_placenames.zip\">PEI Places</a></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>After downloading all seven files, move them into a folder and unzip\nthe zipped files. Take a look at the contents of the folders. You\nwill notice four files with the same name, but different file types.\nWhen you navigate to these folders from GIS software, you will find\nthat you only need to click on the .shp and that the other three\nformats support this file in the background. It is important when\nmoving files on your computer to always move and keep all four files\ntogether. This is one reason Shapefiles are normally shared using\nzip compression. Remember the folder in which you save uncompressed\nshapefile folders, as you will need to find them from within QGIS in\na few minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"starting-your-gis-project\">Starting Your GIS Project</h2>\n<p>Open QGIS. The first thing we need to do is set up the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system\">Coordinate\nReference System</a> (CRS) correctly. The CRS is the map projection and\nprojections are the various ways to represent real world places on\ntwo-dimensional maps. The default is WGS84 (it is increasingly common to\nuse WGS 84 which is compatible with Google Earth type software), but\nsince most of our data and examples are created by Canadian governments\nwe recommend using NAD 83 (North American Datum, 1983). For more on NAD\n83 and the Federal Government&#39;s datum, see <a href=\"http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography-boundary/mapping/topographic-mapping/10272\">NRCan&#39;s website</a>. PEI has\nits own NAD 83 coordinate reference system which uses a <a href=\"http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/index.php3?number=77865&amp;lang=E\">Double\nStereographic projection</a>. Managing the CRS of different layers of\ninformation and making sure they are working correctly is one of the\nmost complicated aspects of GIS for beginners. Nonetheless, if the\nsoftware is setup correctly, it should convert the CRS and allow you to\nwork with data imported from different sources. <em>Select Project\nProperties</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mac: Project–&gt;Project Properties</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis3.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 3&quot; %}</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows: Settings-&gt; Project Properties</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis4.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 4&quot; %}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>In the left window pane select CRS (second from the top)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>click Enable &#39;on the fly&#39; CRS transformation button on top left</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>in the Filter box enter &#39;2291′ – this quickly navigates to the best\nCoordinate reference system for Prince Edward Island.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>under the box titled Coordinate reference systems of the world,\nselect &#39;NAD83(CSRS98) / Prince Edward Isl.

Next to that you will see the geographic location of\nyour mouse pointer in metres</li>\n<li>under Project menu, select Save Project (you should save your\nproject after each step)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are now set up to work on the tutorial project, but might have a few\nquestions about what CRS to use for your own project. WGS83 might work\nin the short term, particularly if you are working on a fairly large\nscale, but it will be difficult to accurately work on local maps. One\nhint is to learn what CRS or Projections is used for paper maps of the\nregion. If you are scanning a good quality paper map to use as the base\nlayer it might be a good idea to use the same projection. You can also\ntry searching the internet for the more common CRS for a particular\nregion. For those of you working on North American projects identifying\nthe correct NAD83 for your region will often be the best CRS. Here are a\nfew links to other resources that will help you choose a CRS for your\nown project: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20180807132308/http://qgis.spatialthoughts.com/2012/04/tutorial-working-with-projections-in.html\">Tutorial: Working with Projections in QGIS</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"building-a-base-map\">Building a Base Map</h3>\n<p>Now that your computer is driving with the right directions, it&#39;s time\nto add some information that makes sense to humans. Your project should\nstart with a base map, or a selection of geospatial information that\nlets your readers recognize real world features on the map. For most\nusers this will be comprised of several &#39;layers&#39; of vector and raster\ndata, which can be rearranged, coloured, and labeled in such a way that\nthey make sense to your readers and your project&#39;s objectives. A\nrelatively new feature on many GIS programs is the availability of\npre-fab base maps, but since this technology is under development for\nopen source platforms like QGIS we will walk through the process of\ncreating our own base map by adding vector and raster layers in this\nmodule. For those who would like to add pre-fab base maps to QGIS, you\ncan try installing the &#39;OpenLayers&#39; Plugin under Plugins-&gt;Manage and\nInstall Plugins. Select &quot;Get More&quot; on the left. Click OpenLayers and\nthen click Install plugin. Click OK and then click close. Once\ninstalled, you&#39;ll find OpenLayers in the Plugins Menu. Try installing\nsome of the different Google and OpenStreetMaps layers. At the time of\nwriting this module, the OpenLayers plugin (v. 1.1.1) installs but fails\nto work properly on any Mac using OSX. It appears to work more\nconsistently on QGIS running on Windows 7. Give it a try, as we expect\nit will only get better in the months ahead. Note, however, that the\nprojection for some of these global maps do not correct on the fly, so\nthe satellite images might not alway sync up with data projected in a\ndifferent CRS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opening-vectors\">Opening Vectors</h2>\n<p>Vectors <a href=\"http://www.gislounge.com/geodatabases-explored-vector-and-raster-data/\">defined</a>: GIS uses points, lines, and polygons, also known as\n<strong>vector</strong> data. Its first order of work is to arrange these points,\nlines, and polygons and project them accurately on maps. Points may be\ntowns or telephone poles; lines could represent rivers, roads, or\nrailroads; and polygons could encompass a farmer&#39;s lot or larger\npolitical boundaries. However, it is also possible to attach historical\ndata to these geographical places and study how people interacted with\nand changed their physical environments. The population of towns\nchanged, rivers moved their courses, lots were subdivided, and land was\nplanted with various crops.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>under Layer on toolbar, choose Add Vector Layer (alternatively the\nsame icon you see next to &#39;Add Vector Layer&#39; can also be selected\nfrom the tool bar on the upper left side)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis6.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 6&quot; %}</p>\n<ul>\n<li>click Browse, find your downloaded Prince Edward Island shapefiles\nin the folder</li>\n<li>open the coastline_polygon folder</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis7.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 7&quot; %}</p>\n<ul>\n<li>select coastline_polygon.shp, then select &#39;OK&#39;, and you should see\nthe island&#39;s coastline on your screen.
