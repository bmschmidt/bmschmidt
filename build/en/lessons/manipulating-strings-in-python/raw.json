Knowing how to manipulate strings plays a crucial role in most\ntext processing tasks. If you’d like to experiment with the following\nlessons, you can write and execute short programs as we’ve been doing in previous lessons in the series,\nor you can open up a Python shell / Terminal to try them out on the\ncommand line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"manipulating-python-strings\">Manipulating Python Strings</h2>\n<p>If you have been exposed to another programming language before, you\nmight have learned that you need to <em>declare</em> or <em>type</em> variables before you\ncan store anything in them. This is not necessary when working with\nstrings in Python. We can create a string simply by putting content\nwrapped with quotation marks into it with an equal sign (=):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message = &quot;Hello World&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"string-operators-adding-and-multiplying\">String Operators: Adding and Multiplying</h2>\n<p>A string is a type of object, one that\nconsists of a series of characters. Python already knows how to deal\nwith a number of general-purpose and powerful representations, including\nstrings. One way to manipulate strings is by using <em>string operators</em>.\nThese operators are represented by symbols that you likely associate\nwith mathematics, such as +, -, *, /, and =. When used with strings,\nthey perform actions that are similar to, but not the same as, their\nmathematical counterparts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"concatenate\">Concatenate</h3>\n<p>This term means to join strings together. The process is known as\n<em>concatenating</em> strings and it is done using the plus (+) operator. Note\nthat you must be explicit about where you want blank spaces to occur by\nplacing them between single quotation marks also.</p>\n<p>In this example, the string &quot;message1&quot; is given the content &quot;hello\nworld&quot;.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message1 = &#39;hello&#39; + &#39; &#39; + &#39;world&#39;\nprint(message1)\n-&gt; hello world\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"multiply\">Multiply</h3>\n<p>If you want multiple copies of a string, use the multiplication (*)\noperator. In this example, string <em>message2a</em> is given the content\n&quot;hello&quot; times three; string <em>message 2b</em> is given content &quot;world&quot;; then\nwe print both strings.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message2a = &#39;hello &#39; * 3\nmessage2b = &#39;world&#39;\nprint(message2a + message2b)\n-&gt; hello hello hello world\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"append\">Append</h3>\n<p>What if you want to add material to the end of a string successively?\nThere is a special operator for that (+=).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message3 = &#39;howdy&#39;\nmessage3 += &#39; &#39;\nmessage3 += &#39;world&#39;\nprint(message3)\n-&gt; howdy world\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"string-methods-finding-changing\">String Methods: Finding, Changing</h2>\n<p>In addition to operators, Python comes pre-installed with dozens of\nstring methods that allow you to do things to strings. Used alone or in\ncombination, these methods can do just about anything you can imagine to\nstrings. The good news is that you can reference a list of String\nMethods on the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods\">Python website</a>, including information on how to use\neach properly. To make sure that you’ve got a basic grasp of string\nmethods, what follows is a brief overview of some of the more commonly\nused ones:</p>\n<h3 id=\"length\">Length</h3>\n<p>You can determine the number of characters in a string using <code>len</code>. Note\nthat the blank space counts as a separate character.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message4 = &#39;hello&#39; + &#39; &#39; + &#39;world&#39;\nprint(len(message4))\n-&gt; 11\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"find\">Find</h3>\n<p>You can search a string for a <em>substring</em> and your program will return the\nstarting index position of that substring. This is helpful for further\nprocessing. Note that indexes are numbered from left to right and that\nthe count starts with position 0, not 1.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message5 = &quot;hello world&quot;\nmessage5a = message5.find(&quot;worl&quot;)\nprint(message5a)\n-&gt; 6\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the substring is not present, the program will return a value of -1.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message6 = &quot;Hello World&quot;\nmessage6b = message6.find(&quot;squirrel&quot;)\nprint(message6b)\n-&gt; -1\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"lower-case\">Lower Case</h3>\n<p>Sometimes it is useful to convert a string to lower case. For example,\nif we standardize case it makes it easier for the computer to recognize\nthat &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;sometimes&quot; are the same word.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message7 = &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;\nmessage7a = message7.lower()\nprint(message7a)\n-&gt; hello world\n</code></pre>\n<p>The opposite effect, raising characters to upper case, can be achieved\nby changing <code>.lower()</code> to <code>.upper()</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"replace\">Replace</h3>\n<p>If you need to replace a substring throughout a string you can do so\nwith the <code>replace</code> method.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message8 = &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;\nmessage8a = message8.replace(&quot;L&quot;, &quot;pizza&quot;)\nprint(message8a)\n-&gt; HEpizzapizzaO WORpizzaD\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"slice\">Slice</h3>\n<p>If you want to <code>slice</code> off unwanted parts of a string from the beginning\nor end you can do so by creating a substring. The same kind of technique\nalso allows you to break a long string into more manageable components.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message9 = &quot;Hello World&quot;\nmessage9a = message9[1:8]\nprint(message9a)\n-&gt; ello Wo\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can substitute variables for the integers used in this example.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">startLoc = 2\nendLoc = 8\nmessage9b = message9[startLoc: endLoc]\nprint(message9b)\n-&gt; llo Wo\n</code></pre>\n<p>This makes it much easier to use this method in conjunction with the\n<code>find</code> method as in the next example, which checks for the letter &quot;d&quot; in\nthe first six characters of &quot;Hello World&quot; and correctly tells us it is\nnot there (-1). This technique is much more useful in longer strings –\nentire documents for example. Note that the absence of an integer before\nthe colon signifies we want to start at the beginning of the string. We\ncould use the same technique to tell the program to go all the way to\nthe end by putting no integer after the colon. And remember, index\npositions start counting from 0 rather than 1.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message9 = &quot;Hello World&quot;\nprint(message9[:5].find(&quot;d&quot;))\n-&gt; -1\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are lots more, but the string methods above are a good start. Note\nthat in this last example, we are using square brackets instead of\nparentheses. This difference in <em>syntax</em> signals an important distinction.\nIn Python, parentheses are usually used to <em>pass an argument</em> to a\nfunction. So when we see something like</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">print(len(message7))\n</code></pre>\n<p>it means pass the string <em>message7</em> to the function <code>len</code> then send the\nreturned value of that function to the <code>print</code> statement to be printed. If\na function can be called without an argument, you often have to include\na pair of empty parentheses after the function name anyway. We saw an\nexample of that, too:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">message7 = &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;\nmessage7a = message7.lower()\nprint(message7a)\n-&gt; hello world\n</code></pre>\n<p>This statement tells Python to apply the <code>lower</code> function to the string\n<em>message7</em> and store the returned value in the string <em>message7a</em>.</p>\n<p>The square brackets serve a different purpose. If you think of a string\nas a sequence of characters, and you want to be able to access the\ncontents of the string by their location within the sequence, then you\nneed some way of giving Python a location within a sequence. That is\nwhat the square brackets do: indicate a beginning and ending location\nwithin a sequence as we saw when using the <code>slice</code> method.</p>\n<h2 id=\"escape-sequences\">Escape Sequences</h2>\n<p>What do you do when you need to include quotation marks within a string?\nYou don’t want the Python interpreter to get the wrong idea and end the\nstring when it comes across one of these characters. In Python, you can\nput a backslash (\\) in front of a quotation mark so that it doesn&#39;t\nterminate the string. These are known as escape sequences.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">print(&#39;\\&quot;&#39;)\n-&gt; &quot;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">print(&#39;The program printed \\&quot;hello world\\&quot;&#39;)\n-&gt; The program printed &quot;hello world&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Two other escape sequences allow you to print tabs and newlines:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">print(&#39;hello\\thello\\thello\\nworld&#39;)\n-&gt;hello hello hello\nworld\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"suggested-reading\">Suggested Reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Lutz, <em>Learning Python</em><ul>\n<li>Ch. 7: Strings</li>\n<li>Ch. 8: Lists and Dictionaries</li>\n<li>Ch. 10: Introducing Python Statements</li>\n<li>Ch. 15: Function Basics</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"code-syncing\">Code Syncing</h2>\n<p>To follow along with future lessons it is important that you have the\nright files and programs in your programming-historian directory.
