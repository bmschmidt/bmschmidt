<h1>Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding Layers</h1>

<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>{% include toc.html %}</p>
<h2>Lesson Goals</h2>
<p>In this lesson you will install QGIS software, download geospatial files
like shapefiles and GeoTIFFs, and create a map out of a number of vector
and raster layers. Quantum or QGIS is an open source alternative to the
industry leader, ArcGIS from ESRI. QGIS is multiplatform, which means it
runs on Windows, Macs, and Linux and it has many of the functions most
commonly used by historians. ArcGIS is prohibitively expensive and only
runs on Windows (though software can be purchased to allow it to run on
Mac). However, many universities have site licenses, meaning students
and employees have access to free copies of the software (try contacting
your map librarian, computer services, or the geography department).
QGIS is ideal for those without access to a free copy of Arc and it is
also a good option for learning basic GIS skills and deciding if you
want to install a copy of ArcGIS on your machine. Moreover, any work you
do in QGIS can be exported to ArcGIS at a later date if you decide to
upgrade. The authors tend to use both and are happy to run QGIS on Mac
and Linux computers for basic tasks, but still return to ArcGIS for more
advanced work. In many cases it is not lack of functions, but stability
issues that bring us back to ArcGIS. For those who are learning Python
with the Programming Historian, you will be glad to know that both QGIS
and ArcGIS use Python as their main scripting language.</p>
<h2>Installing QGIS</h2>
<p>Navigate to the <a href="http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html">QGIS Download page</a>. The procedure is a little
different depending on your operating system. Click on the appropriate
Operating System. Follow the instructions below.</p>
<h4>Mac Instructions</h4>
<ul>
<li>For most people it will be best to choose Master release (the one
that has a single installer package). You will still need to install
other software packages before installing QGIS. Under &quot;Download for Mac OS X&quot;, click on
the link (<a href="http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis">KyngChaos Qgis download page</a>) and download the
file (see screen shot below): 1) QGIS 2.18.13-1 (under
Download) for your respective Mac OS (this works with versions from Lion onwards). Then go to the left &quot;software menu&quot; and click on    &quot;<a href="http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/archive">Download Archive</a>&quot;. Under &quot;GDAL Complete&quot; download the file 2) GDAL complete 1.11
framework package (under Requirements). Install the framework package like any other Mac programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis1.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 1: Click to view full-size image&quot; %}</p>
<ul>
<li>once the frameworks are installed, download and install QGIS.</li>
<li>as with any other Mac application you are using for the first time,
you will have to go find the QGIS application in Applications</li>
</ul>
<h4>Windows Instructions</h4>
<ul>
<li>under Standalone Installer, click on the link to Download QGIS</li>
</ul>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis2.jpg&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 2&quot; %}</p>
<ul>
<li>double-click on the <code>.exe</code> file to execute</li>
</ul>
<p>QGIS is very simple to install in most versions of Linux. Follow the
instructions on the download page.</p>
<h3>Prince Edward Island Data</h3>
<p>We will be using some government data from the Canadian province of
Prince Edward Island. PEI is a great example because there is a lot of
data for free online and because it is Canada's smallest province,
making the downloads quick! Download PEI shapefiles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the links below in your web browser, read/accept the
license agreement, and then download the following (they will ask
for your name and email with each download). We created the final
two shapefiles, so they should download directly:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=coastline&amp;file_format=SHP">http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=coastline&amp;file_format=SHP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=lot_town&amp;file_format=SHP">http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=lot_town&amp;file_format=SHP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=hydronetwork&amp;file_format=SHP">http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=hydronetwork&amp;file_format=SHP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=forest_35&amp;file_format=SHP">http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=forest_35&amp;file_format=SHP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=nat_parks&amp;file_format=SHP">http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/license_agreement.php3?name=nat_parks&amp;file_format=SHP</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/PEI_highway.zip">PEI Highways</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/PEI_placenames.zip">PEI Places</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>After downloading all seven files, move them into a folder and unzip
the zipped files. Take a look at the contents of the folders. You
will notice four files with the same name, but different file types.
When you navigate to these folders from GIS software, you will find
that you only need to click on the .shp and that the other three
formats support this file in the background. It is important when
moving files on your computer to always move and keep all four files
together. This is one reason Shapefiles are normally shared using
zip compression. Remember the folder in which you save uncompressed
shapefile folders, as you will need to find them from within QGIS in
a few minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starting Your GIS Project</h2>
<p>Open QGIS. The first thing we need to do is set up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system">Coordinate
Reference System</a> (CRS) correctly. The CRS is the map projection and
projections are the various ways to represent real world places on
two-dimensional maps. The default is WGS84 (it is increasingly common to
use WGS 84 which is compatible with Google Earth type software), but
since most of our data and examples are created by Canadian governments
we recommend using NAD 83 (North American Datum, 1983). For more on NAD
83 and the Federal Government's datum, see <a href="http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography-boundary/mapping/topographic-mapping/10272">NRCan's website</a>. PEI has
its own NAD 83 coordinate reference system which uses a <a href="http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/index.php3?number=77865&amp;lang=E">Double
Stereographic projection</a>. Managing the CRS of different layers of
information and making sure they are working correctly is one of the
most complicated aspects of GIS for beginners. Nonetheless, if the
software is setup correctly, it should convert the CRS and allow you to
work with data imported from different sources. <em>Select Project

</li>
<li>
<p>under the box titled Coordinate reference systems of the world,
select 'NAD83(CSRS98) / Prince Edward Isl. (Stereographic)' and hit
OK</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis5.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 5&quot; %}</p>
<ul>
<li>notice the projection has changed in the bottom right corner of the
QGIS window. Next to that you will see the geographic location of
your mouse pointer in metres</li>
<li>under Project menu, select Save Project (you should save your
project after each step)</li>
</ul>
<p>You are now set up to work on the tutorial project, but might have a few
questions about what CRS to use for your own project. WGS83 might work
in the short term, particularly if you are working on a fairly large
scale, but it will be difficult to accurately work on local maps. One
hint is to learn what CRS or Projections is used for paper maps of the
region. If you are scanning a good quality paper map to use as the base
layer it might be a good idea to use the same projection. You can also
try searching the internet for the more common CRS for a particular
region. For those of you working on North American projects identifying
the correct NAD83 for your region will often be the best CRS. Here are a
few links to other resources that will help you choose a CRS for your
own project: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180807132308/http://qgis.spatialthoughts.com/2012/04/tutorial-working-with-projections-in.html">Tutorial: Working with Projections in QGIS</a></p>
<h3>Building a Base Map</h3>
<p>Now that your computer is driving with the right directions, it's time
to add some information that makes sense to humans. Your project should
start with a base map, or a selection of geospatial information that
lets your readers recognize real world features on the map. For most
users this will be comprised of several 'layers' of vector and raster
data, which can be rearranged, coloured, and labeled in such a way that
they make sense to your readers and your project's objectives. A
relatively new feature on many GIS programs is the availability of
pre-fab base maps, but since this technology is under development for
open source platforms like QGIS we will walk through the process of
creating our own base map by adding vector and raster layers in this
module. For those who would like to add pre-fab base maps to QGIS, you
can try installing the 'OpenLayers' Plugin under Plugins-&gt;Manage and
Install Plugins. Select &quot;Get More&quot; on the left. Click OpenLayers and
then click Install plugin. Click OK and then click close. Once
installed, you'll find OpenLayers in the Plugins Menu. Try installing
some of the different Google and OpenStreetMaps layers. At the time of
writing this module, the OpenLayers plugin (v. 1.1.1) installs but fails
to work properly on any Mac using OSX. It appears to work more
consistently on QGIS running on Windows 7. Give it a try, as we expect
it will only get better in the months ahead. Note, however, that the
projection for some of these global maps do not correct on the fly, so
the satellite images might not alway sync up with data projected in a
different CRS.</p>
<h2>Opening Vectors</h2>
<p>Vectors <a href="http://www.gislounge.com/geodatabases-explored-vector-and-raster-data/">defined</a>: GIS uses points, lines, and polygons, also known as
<strong>vector</strong> data. Its first order of work is to arrange these points,
lines, and polygons and project them accurately on maps. Points may be
towns or telephone poles; lines could represent rivers, roads, or
railroads; and polygons could encompass a farmer's lot or larger
political boundaries. However, it is also possible to attach historical
data to these geographical places and study how people interacted with
and changed their physical environments. The population of towns
changed, rivers moved their courses, lots were subdivided, and land was
planted with various crops.</p>
<ul>
<li>under Layer on toolbar, choose Add Vector Layer (alternatively the
same icon you see next to 'Add Vector Layer' can also be selected
from the tool bar on the upper left side)</li>
</ul>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis6.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 6&quot; %}</p>

<li>open the coastline_polygon folder</li>
</ul>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis7.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 7&quot; %}</p>
<ul>
<li>select coastline_polygon.shp, then select 'OK', and you should see
the island's coastline on your screen. Sometimes QGIS adds a
coloured background (see the image above). If you have a coloured
background, follow the steps below. If not, skip down the page to
the ***.</li>
<li>right click the layer (coastline_polygon) in the Layers menu and
choose Properties.\</li>
</ul>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis8.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 8&quot; %}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the ensuing window, click Style in the left pane</p>

<li>click Browse, find your downloaded Prince Edward Island shapefiles
in the folder</li>
<li>double-click on '1935 inventory_region.shp' and then hit 'Open'</li>
</ul>
<p>This will add a dense map showing the different forest cover in 1935.
However, to see the different categories, you will need to change the
symbology to represent the different categories of forest with different
colours. We will need to know which column of the database tables
includes the forest category information, so the first step is to open
and inspect the attribute table.</p>
<ul>
<li>right click on the 1935_inventory_region layer in the Layers
window on the left and click on Open Attribute Table</li>
</ul>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis13.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 13&quot; %}</p>
<p>An Attribute Table will open. It has a number of categories and
identifiers. Of particular interest is the LANDUSE category which
provides information on the forest cover in 1935. We will now show you
how to display these categories on the map.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis14.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 14&quot; %}</p>
<ul>
<li>Close the Attribute Table, and right click on the

the different settings to see how symbols and displays change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in the Layers menu you can add and remove the various layers
we've added to the map much the same way you did in Google Earth. Click
on the check boxes to remove and add the various layers. Drag and drop
layers to change the the order they appear. Dragging a layer to the top
will place it above the rest of the layers and make it the most
prominent. For example, if you drag 'coastline_polygon' to the top, you
have a simplified outline of the province along with place names.</p>

<ul>
<li>Along the toolbar on the top left of the main window are icons that
allow you to explore the map. The hand symbol, for example, allows
you to click on the map and move it around, while the magnifying
glass symbols with plus and minus on them allow you to zoom in and
out. Play with these and familiarize yourself with the various
functions</li>

<ul>
<li>having created a map using vector layers, we will now add or use our
first raster layer. This is a good time to save your work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opening Rasters</strong>: <strong>Raster</strong> data are digital images made up of grids.
All remote sensing data such as satellite images or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthophoto">aerial photos</a>
are rasters, but usually you can't see the grids in these images because
they are made up of tiny pixels. Each pixel has its own value and when
those values are symbolized in colour or greyscale they make up an image
that is useful for display or topographical analysis. A scanned
historical map is also brought into GIS in raster format.</p>
<ul>
<li>download: <a href="/assets/PEI_CumminsMap1927_compLZW.tif">PEI_CumminsMap1927.tif</a> to your project folder.</li>
<li>under Layer on toolbar, choose Add Raster Layer (alternatively the
same icon you see next to 'Add Raster Layer' can also be selected
from the tool bar along the left side of the window)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>find the file you have downloaded titled 'PEI_CumminsMap1927.tif'</li>
<li>you will be prompted to define this layer's coordinate system. In
the Filter box search for '2291′, then in the box below select

</ul>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis28.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 28&quot; %}</p>
<ul>
<li>If the program does not prompt you for the CRS you need to change it
yourself. Double click the PEI_CummingMap1927_compLZW layer and
choose '<strong>General</strong>' from the menu on the left. Click '<strong>Specify…</strong>'
beside the box showing the incorrect Coordinate reference system.
Then follow the instructions above (choose 2291).</li>
</ul>

Move it to the bottom of the menu if necessary:</li>
</ul>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis30.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 30&quot; %}</p>
<ul>
<li>Now we would like to make the coastline more visible, so
double-click on 'coastline_polygon' and select 'Style' on the left.
In the box under Symbol layers, select 'Simple fill' and options
appear in the box to the right. Click on the menu next to 'Border'
and make it red, and then beside Border width change it to 0.5, and
click OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;qgis31.png&quot; caption=&quot;Figure 31&quot; %}</p>
<ul>
<li>You are now able to see the background raster map through the
'coastline_polygon' layer. Zoom in for closer inspection, and you
should be able to see the coastline layer clearly. Notice that the
alignment is relatively good, but not perfect. We will learn more in
lesson 4 about the challenges of georeferencing historical maps to
give them real world coordinates.</li>
