This version of Python will be deprecated at the end of 2019, so you will have to install Python 3. Download the latest\nstable release of the Python programming language (Version 3.8 as of\nNovember 2019) and install it by following the instructions on the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/\">Python\nwebsite</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-a-directory\">Create a Directory</h3>\n<p>To stay organized, it’s best to have a dedicated directory (folder) on\nyour computer where you will keep your Python programs (e.g.,\n<code>programming-historian</code>). Save it anywhere you like on your hard\ndrive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"install-a-text-editor\">Install a text editor</h3>\n<p>There are many text editors that you can use to write, store, and run Python commands. Komodo Edit is the one used in this lesson. It is a free and open source code editor. If you prefer to use\nanother editor, there are many <a href=\"http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors/\">other text editing options</a>. Some of our\ntesters prefer a program called <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a>. Which you use is up to\nyou, but for the sake of consistency in our lessons, we will be using\nKomodo Edit. You can download a copy of Komodo Edit from the <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit\">Komodo\nEdit website</a>. Install it from the <code>.DMG</code> file</p>\n<h5 id=\"make-a-run-python-command-in-komodo-edit\">Make a “Run Python” Command in Komodo Edit</h5>\n<p>Now you need to set up the editor so that you can run Python\nprograms.</p>\n<p>If you don’t see the Toolbox pane on the right hand side, choose\n<code>View-&gt;Tabs &amp; Sidebars -&gt;Toolbox</code>. In the Toolbox window, click on the gear icon and select\n“<code>New Command…</code>“. This will open a new dialog window. Rename your\ncommand to “<code>Run Python</code>” and feel free to change the icon if you\nlike. In the “<code>Command</code>” box, type</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">%(python3) %f\n</code></pre>\n<p>and on the Advanced Options tab under &quot;Start in,&quot; enter</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">%D\n</code></pre>\n<p>Click OK. Your new Run Python command should appear in the Toolbox\npane.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step-2--hello-world-in-python\">Step 2 – “Hello World” in Python</h2>\n<p>It is traditional to begin programming in a new language by trying to\ncreate a program that says ‘hello world’ and terminates. We will show\nyou how to do this in Python and HTML.</p>\n<p>Python is a good programming language for beginners because it is very\nhigh-level. It is possible, in other words, to write short programs that\naccomplish a lot. The shorter the program, the more likely it is for the\nwhole thing to fit on one screen, and the easier it is to keep track of\nall of it in your mind.</p>\n<p>Python is an &#39;interpreted&#39; programming language. This means that\nthere is a special computer program (known as an interpreter) that knows\nhow to follow instructions written in that language. One way to use the\ninterpreter is to store all of your instructions in a file, and then run\nthe interpreter on the file. A file that contains programming language\ninstructions is known as a program. The interpreter will execute each of\nthe instructions that you gave it in your program and then stop. Let’s\ntry this.</p>\n<p>In your text editor, create a new file, enter the following two-line\nprogram and save it to your <code>programming-historian</code> directory as\n<code>hello-world.py</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># hello-world.py\nprint(&#39;hello world&#39;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Your chosen text editor should have a “<code>Run</code>” button that will allow you\nto execute your program. If you are using BBEdit, click on the\n“#!” button and Run. If all went well, it should look something like\nthis:</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;BBEdit-hello-world.png&quot; caption=&quot;&#39;Hello World&#39; in Python on a Mac&quot; %}</p>\n<h3 id=\"interacting-with-a-python-shell\">Interacting with a Python shell</h3>\n<p>Another way to interact with an interpreter is to use what is known as a\nshell. You can type in a statement and press the Enter key, and the\nshell will respond to your command. Using a shell is a great way to test\nstatements to make sure that they do what you think they should. This is\ndone slightly differently on Mac, Linux and Windows.</p>\n<p>You can run a Python shell by launching the &#39;terminal&#39;. On the Mac, open\nthe Finder and double-click on <code>Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Terminal</code>\nthen typing “<code>python3</code>” into the window that opens on your screen. At the\nPython shell prompt, type</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">print(&#39;hello world&#39;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>and press Enter. The computer will respond with</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">hello world\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we want to represent an interaction with the shell, we will use\n<code>-&gt;</code> to indicate the shell’s response to your command, as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">print(&#39;hello world&#39;)\n-&gt; hello world\n</code></pre>\n<p>On your screen, it will look more like this:</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;hello-world-terminal.png&quot; caption=&quot;Python Shell in Mac Terminal&quot; %}</p>\n<p>Now that you and your computer are up and running, we can move onto some\nmore interesting tasks.
