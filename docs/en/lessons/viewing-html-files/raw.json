Your browser already knows how to interpret HTML, which is\nhandy for human readers. Most browsers also let you see the HTML <em>source code</em>\nfor any page that you visit. The two images below show a typical web\npage (from the <em>Old Bailey Online</em>) and the HTML source used to generate\nthat page, which you can see with the\n<code>Tools -&gt; Web Developer -&gt; Page Source</code> menu item in Firefox.</p>\n<p>When you&#39;re working in the browser, you typically don&#39;t want or need to\nsee the source for a web page. If you are writing a page of your own,\nhowever, it can be very useful to see how other people accomplished a\nparticular effect. You will also want to study HTML source as you write\nprograms to manipulate web pages or automatically extract information\nfrom them.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;obo.png&quot; caption=&quot;Old Bailey Online screenshot&quot; %}</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;obo-page-source.png&quot; caption=&quot;HTML Source for Old Bailey Online Web Page&quot; %}</p>\n<p>(To learn more about HTML, you may find it useful at this point to work\nthrough the <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp\">W3 Schools HTML tutorial</a>. Detailed knowledge of HTML\nisn&#39;t immediately necessary to continue reading, but any time that you\nspend learning HTML will be amply rewarded in your work as a digital\nhistorian or digital humanist.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"hello-world-in-html-1\">&quot;Hello World&quot; in HTML</h2>\n<p>HTML is what is known as a <em>markup</em> language. In other words, HTML is\ntext that has been &quot;marked up&quot; with <em>tags</em> that provide information for\nthe interpreter (which is often a web browser). Suppose you are\nformatting a bibliographic entry and you want to indicate the title of a\nwork by italicizing it. In HTML you use <code>em</code> tags (&quot;em&quot; stands for\nemphasis). So part of your HTML file might look like this</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">... in Cohen and Rosenzweig&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Digital History&lt;/em&gt;, for example ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>The simplest HTML file consists of tags which indicate the beginning and\nend of the whole document, and tags which identify a <code>head</code> and a <code>body</code>\nwithin that document. Information about the file usually goes into the\nhead, whereas information that will be displayed on the screen usually\ngoes into the body.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;Hello World!&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can try creating some HTML code. In your text editor, create\na new file. Copy the code below into the editor. The first line tells\nthe browser what kind of file it is. The <code>html</code> tag has the text direction\nset to <code>ltr</code> (left to right) and the <code>lang</code> (language) set to US English.\nThe <code>title</code> tag in the head of the HTML document contains material that is\nusually displayed in the top bar of a window when the page is being\nviewed, and in Firefox tabs.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;&lt;!-- Insert your title here --&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Insert your content here --&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Change both</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;!-- Insert your title here --&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;!-- Insert your content here --&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>to</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">Hello World!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Save the file to your <code>programming-historian</code> directory as\n<code>hello-world.html</code>. Now go to Firefox and choose <code>File -&gt; New Tab</code> and\nthen <code>File -&gt; Open File</code>. Choose <code>hello-world.html</code>. Depending on your\ntext editor you may have a &#39;view page in browser&#39; or &#39;open in browser&#39;\noption. Once you have opened the file, your message should appear in the\nbrowser. Note the difference between opening an HTML file with a browser\nlike Firefox (which interprets it) and opening the same file with your\ntext editor (which does not).</p>\n<h2 id=\"suggested-readings-for-learning-html\">Suggested readings for learning HTML</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp\">W3 Schools HTML Tutorial</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp\">W3 Schools HTML5 Tutorial</a></li>\n</ul>\n"}
