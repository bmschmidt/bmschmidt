Click on <strong>Add Your Site</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-have-a-new-omeka-site\">You have a new Omeka site!</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-03.png&quot; caption=&quot;View your site&quot; %}</p>\n<p>To see what it looks like, click on <strong>View Site</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-empty-omeka-site\">An empty Omeka site</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-04.png&quot; caption=&quot;Public view&quot; %}\nThis is your empty Omeka site, waiting to be filled in. To get back to your dashboard, click the <strong>Back</strong> button or enter <strong><a href=\"http://www.omeka.net/dashboard\">http://www.omeka.net/dashboard</a></strong>. This time, click on <strong>Manage Site</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"switch-themes\">Switch themes</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-05.png&quot; caption=&quot;Theme settings page&quot; %}</p>\n<p>Omeka allows you to change the look of your public-facing site by switching themes. To do this, click on <strong>Appearance</strong> (at the top right of your dashboard). Switch themes by selecting one of the options on the page. Press the green <strong>Use this theme</strong> button to activate your new theme. Then visit your public site by clicking on the name of your site at the top left of the page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-have-a-new-theme\">You have a new theme!</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-06.png&quot; caption=&quot;Public view with the new theme&quot; %}</p>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve checked out your new theme, head back to your dashboard. You can switch back to your old theme, stick with this one, or select one of the other options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"install-some-plugins\">Install some plugins</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-07.png&quot; caption=&quot;Plugins page&quot; %}</p>\n<p>Your Omeka site comes with plugins, which offer some extra\nfunctionality. We need to enable them. To do that, click on the\n<strong>Plugins</strong> menu item at the top right. On the following page, click the <strong>Install</strong> button for <strong>Exhibit Builder</strong> (leave the options as they are on the page that follows) and <strong>Simple Pages</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"add-an-item-to-your-archive\">Add an item to your archive</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-08.png&quot; caption=&quot;Add an item&quot; %}</p>\n<p>Click on <strong>Items</strong> on the left-hand menu and then (naturally!) <strong>Add an item.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"describe-your-new-item\">Describe your new item</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-09.png&quot; caption=&quot;Make your item Public using checkbox circled here&quot; %}</p>\n<p>Remember, <strong>Dublin Core</strong> refers to the descriptive information you&#39;ll enter about your item. All of this information is optional, and you can&#39;t really do it wrong. But try to be consistent.</p>\n<p>Be sure to click the <strong>Public</strong> checkbox so that your item is viewable by the general public. If you don&#39;t click that box, only people who are logged into your site will be able to see the item.</p>\n<p>To add multiple fields — for example, if you want to add multiple subjects for your item — use the green <strong>Add input</strong> button to the left of the text boxes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-tricky-question\">A tricky question</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-10.png&quot; caption=&quot;What is this?&quot; %}</p>\n<p>I&#39;m creating an item record for my dog, Bertie. But am I describing Bertie <em>himself</em> or a <em>photograph</em> of Bertie? If it&#39;s the former, the <strong>Creator</strong> would be — well, I guess that depends on your religious outlook. If it&#39;s the latter, the creator would be Brad Wallace, who took the photo.</p>\n<p>The decision about whether you&#39;re describing the object or the representation of the object is up to you. But once you&#39;ve decided, be consistent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attach-a-file-to-your-item-record\">Attach a file to your item record</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-11.png&quot; caption=&quot;Adding files to an item&quot; %}</p>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve finished adding Dublin Core metadata, you can attach a file to your item record by clicking <strong>Files</strong> at the top of the Dublin Core form. (You don&#39;t have to click <strong>Add Item</strong> before you do this; Omeka will automatically save your information.) You can add multiple files, but be aware that the Basic plan only comes with 500 MB of storage space.</p>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve added a file or files, you can add <strong>Tags</strong> by clicking on the button. You can also click on <strong>Item Type Metadata</strong> to choose the kind of thing — person, place, animal, vegetable, mineral — your item is. If you don&#39;t see the appropriate item type for your item, don&#39;t worry. We can add a new item type later.</p>\n<p>When you&#39;re all done, click the green <strong>Add Item</strong> button.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-have-an-item\">You have an item!</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-12.png&quot; caption=&quot;Browse Items, Admin view&quot; %}</p>\n<p>This list contains all the items you&#39;ve added. If the item were not public, it would have (Private) after the title. To see what the page for your new item looks like, click on the name of the item.</p>\n<h2 id=\"this-is-not-the-public-page-for-your-item\">This is not the public page for your item.</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-13.png&quot; caption=&quot;Item show, admin view&quot; %}</p>\n<p>It may look like it, but this page isn&#39;t what a non-logged-in user will see when she navigates to the page for your item. To see what a user would see, click on the blue <strong>View Public Page</strong> button on the right. (Or you can edit the item by clicking on <strong>Edit this item</strong> at the top right.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"this-is-the-public-page-for-your-item\">This is the public page for your item</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-14.png&quot; caption=&quot;Item show, public view&quot; %}</p>\n<p>This is what a general user will see if she navigates to your page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"create-a-collection\">Create a collection</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-15.png&quot; caption=&quot;Add a Collection&quot; %}</p>\n<p>You can begin to bring order to your list of items by grouping them together in collections. To do this, return to your dashboard, click on the <strong>Collections</strong> tab, and click on <strong>Add a Collection</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enter-information-about-your-collection\">Enter information about your collection</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-16.png&quot; caption=&quot;Add collection metadata&quot; %}</p>\n<p>In Omeka, metadata is king! Enter some information about your new collection, and remember to click on the <strong>Public</strong> button near the bottom of the page. Then save your collection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"add-items-to-your-collection\">Add items to your collection</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-17.png&quot; caption=&quot;Click the item checkbox to batch edit&quot; %}</p>\n<p>To fill up the collection you just created, click on the <strong>Items</strong> tab. From your <strong>Browse Items</strong> list, click the boxes of the items that belong in your new collection. Then click on the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choose-the-collection\">Choose the collection</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-18.png&quot; caption=&quot;Select a collection from the dropdown&quot; %}</p>\n<p>On the <strong>Batch Edit Items</strong> page, select the Collection you&#39;d like to add your items to. (Also, take note of all the other things you can do on this page.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"check-out-your-new-collection\">Check out your new collection</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html filename=&quot;up-and-running-19.png&quot; caption=&quot;Browse collections, public view&quot; %}</p>\n<p>Return to your public site. If you click on the <strong>Browse Collections</strong> tab on the public-facing site, you should now have a new collection containing the items you identified.</p>\n<p>Now that you&#39;ve added some items and grouped them into a collection, take some time to play with your site. It&#39;s beginning to take shape now that you have both individual items and thematic units. But Omeka can do even more. We&#39;ll talk about that in the next lesson.</p>\n<h2 id=\"further-resources\">Further Resources</h2>\n<p>The Omeka team has put together great resources on the software&#39;s <a href=\"http://info.omeka.net\">help pages</a></p>\n"}
